> What do you think are the greatest risk areas in completing the project?

## I think the greatest risk in completing the project was the lack of guidelines and expectation from the client. Even though they gave complete control over the architecture, there was very little style guide provided, so there is a risk the client might not like the finished product.

> What changes/additions would you make to the design?

## One of the requirements was to add a create article feature, so the designs need to be updated to reflect this. Same goes for the login screen.

> List a two or three features that you would consider implementing in the future that would add significant value to the project.

## I would add a description field to article object so that the user can add a brief summary when creating an article. A sign up/registration flow and a 'Log out' button would also add value. Adding an article should scroll the page down to newly created article. Animate articles when up-voting.

> Describe the major design/build decisions and why you made them.

## I used React coupled with Redux which makes it very easy to handle application state. I used Bootstrap 4 for layout and styling because it gives basic responsiveness and aesthetically pleasing components out of the box.

> How long did the assignment take (in hours)? Please break down your answer into buckets (e.g. "Learning Framework", "Coding", "Debugging").

## In total the assignment took about 18 hours over the course of 6 days (roughly 3 hours per day). Most of that time was spent coding, with the exception of looking through Bootstrap docs for styling purposes.

> If you could go back and give yourself advice at the beginning of the project, what would it be?

## I was styling my components mainly for desktop when I should've been designing them for mobile first. Seeig as it's only supposed to be a wireframe, I probably could've spent less time on it, but I wanted to showcase my skills for the assignment :)

> Did you learn anything new?

## I've been working a lot with React Native lately, so I had to refresh my memory on how to handle input fields on the web (using the event property and currying).

> Do you feel that this assignment allowed you to showcase your abilities effectively?

## Yes.

> Are there any significant web development-related skills that you possess that were not demonstrated in this exercise? If so, what are they?

## It would've been nice if you guys provided some endpoints with dummy data instead of having to generate my own. This way I could demonstrate my ability to work with API calls and handle requests properly.
