Please feel free to ask questions!

**Create a `README.md` file with simple instructions to run the app.**

First and foremost, this project is meant for you to showcase what you can do with JavaScript (and CSS) as a front end developer. We are looking to see if you can write and understand CSS (preprocessors are okay) and how you handle and structure your JS without complete reliance on a framework (though, a framework is a-okay to use). Specifically, we will be looking for best practices, your development process, design decisions, and overall project structure.

## M-V-P! M-V-P!

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to create a prototype of a (definitely unique) comment system for our (incredibly real) client. As an initial goal, they want to create something similar to Reddit and/or HackerNews. And, since they are very real, they are giving _you_ complete control over the architecture of how the system works!

### Tasks

-   (Required) Create a user login
-   (Required) Create new article
-   (Required) Vote on article
-   (Required) Articles should always be ordered by number of votes (most voted 1st)
-   (Required) Expand article to view comments
-   (Required) Post a comment for an article
-   (Required) Responsive layout - Mocks included for mobile view only, rest is up to you!

**Note**: The user login **does not** have to be robust. It can be as simple as an `<input/>` that accepts a username. It should be used as a basic gateway for preforming actions (ie. a user must be logged in to: comment, reply, and vote on a comment).

Since this is a prototype, please fill the page with a few dummy articles / comments :)

For this project, you can store articles using localStorage, or directly in your JS app.

We do ask that the user actions be more than simple jQuery-like DOM manipulation. There doesn't need to be a backend but interactions with components should simulate a request-response.
